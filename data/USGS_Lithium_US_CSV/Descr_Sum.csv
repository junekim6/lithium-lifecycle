Estimation of the Reynolds Member, Smackover Formation has been estimated using the relation: Lithium Resource = Paverage × VAquifer × Caverage, where Paverage = Average global block model porosity (11.6%) calculated by using the volume-weighted average porosity of the brine units and their respective unit areas; VAquifer = Total volume of the Reynolds Member aquifer (30.427 km3); and Caverage is the average concentration of Li in brine that was collected at the brine supply wells (164.9 mg/L Li).

It is thought to be associated with the interbedded clays, and a marked negative grade correlation with Boron does exist. In addition, historical assays has intermittent lithium analyses, and by convention non-assayed intervals are assigned a zero grade. Current efforts are under way in determining the leaching potential of lithium from the clays. It should be noted that due to these factors, and to the fact that lithium is reported as a by-product, and thus within the higher grade boron zones, the reported lithium grade is significantly lower than some of the higher grade intersections seen.”",Fourie (2018),"Appendix A, Table 1 Section 3—Estimation and Reporting of Mineral Resources"

The borate mineralization occurs primarily as colemanite (2CaO 3B2O3 5H2O) in thinly laminated silt, clay and gypsum beds. In plan view, the concentration of boron-rich evaporites is roughly ellipsoidal with the long axis trending N40-50W. A zone of >5% B2O3 mineralization, ranging in thickness from 20 m to 68 m (70 ft to 225 ft), is approximately 600 m wide and 2,500 m long (Figure 4.3 in May 2017 Prospectus). Boron is believed to have been sourced from thermal waters that flowed from hot springs in the region during times of active volcanism. These hot springs vented into the Hector Basin that contained a large desert lake. Borates were precipitated as the thermal waters entered the lake and cooled or as the lake waters evaporated and became saturated with boron. Based on assay results, it appears if mineralization took place in several cycles, resulting in somewhat distinct mineralized horizons.”",Fourie (2018),"Appendix A, Table 1, Section 2—Reporting of Exploration Results"
